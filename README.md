# cloudnativespring

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
To build and run the application, use the *Gradle* tool window by clicking the Gradle icon in the right-hand toolbar,
or run it directly from the terminal:

* Run `./gradlew run` to build and run the application.
* Run `./gradlew build` to only build the application.
* Run `./gradlew check` to run all checks, including tests.
* Run `./gradlew clean` to clean all build outputs.

Note the usage of the Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew`).
This is the suggested way to use Gradle in production projects.
